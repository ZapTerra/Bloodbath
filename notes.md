I learned a whole bunch about css alignments, styles, and effects. I learned about grid alignments and animations for the hourglass effect and svg effects for the awesome blood warble in the background.

I learned about React components, their structure, how to build a page out of them and use a router to create a single-page application.

I learned about how to create interactive components of a page using React and JavaScript.

I learned how to create endpoints for a web application.

I learned how to use those endpoints to interact with, retrieve and store data within a database.
